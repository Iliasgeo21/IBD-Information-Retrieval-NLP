# 📁 Data Folder

This folder is intentionally empty.

The dataset used in this project — **PubMed 200k RCT** — is not included in this repository due to its large size and licensing restrictions.

## ✅ How to download the dataset

You can download the dataset from Kaggle:

🔗 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/matthewjansen/pubmed-200k-rtc

After downloading, extract the files and place them inside the `data/` folder.

## ✅ Expected files

After extraction, the folder should look like this:

```

data/
│── train.csv
│── train.txt
│── dev.csv
│── dev.txt
│── test.csv
└── test.txt

```


These files are required for the notebook and Python scripts to run.
